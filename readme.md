Several aspects of the terminal can be customized. You can set the background to any image or video. You can define your own ASCII for the splash screen. You can define the colors for most things. You can set your own border image for the window.

Audio effects can also be customized. Specific files can be used for clicks, login, logout and as an ambient noise.
