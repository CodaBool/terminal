> Foundry module to create interactive terminals with custom content and theming

# 🗺️ Welcome
Here find the following:

- A [Usage](https://github.com/CodaBool/terminal#-usage) section. Detailing how to use the module.
- Track [issues](https://github.com/CodaBool/terminal/issues)
- Keep a [changelog](https://github.com/CodaBool/terminal/blob/main/changelog.md) of features

# 🔑 Access
> This is key based content. Meaning it will be a one time purchase, all future updates come free.

You can purchase a key to permanently tie to your Foundry accout at [codabool.itch.io/terminal](https://codabool.itch.io/terminal)

# 🔨 Usage
1. Complete the Access section. Ensuring to tie the key to your [Foundry account](https://foundryvtt.com/me/purchases).
2. In your Foundry server before launching a world go to the setup screen and view the "Add-on Modules" tab. Click "Install Module" and type into the search "terminal". You should see a package called Terminal by CodaBool, click "Install".
3. Now go into a game world you have created. Go to settings > Manage Modules, enable the terminal module
4. Place a tile and click "Create Tile"
5. Double click your created tile to see the tile's settings
6. Click on the new tab called Terminal
6. Enable the Terminal by clicking the Enable checkbox and then click the "Assign Journal" button
7. Select a journal from your list of journals
8. Move onto the tile with any token

### 🎨 Customize
You can change the color and ASCII art of the terminal. Go to your Game Settings and filter to Terminal. You can set the colors and splash art.

### 🎈 Stretch Goals
Will be making a priority for stability for the first couple patches. However, once those are through there are some additional features I want to add:

- sound effects (disk spinup, ambient computer noises. Customizable)
- preset styles to match with popular game systems like Star Wars or Cyberpunk
- hacking / puzzle minigames
- controls for ships / vehicle
- reveal map
