A FoundryVTT module to create interactive terminals with custom content and theming

# 🚩 Context
This is the public facing repo which reflects changes to a private repo. I use this repo to keep record of the following things:

1. Once published, this will have a Usage section. Detailing how to use the module.
2. Track [issues](https://github.com/CodaBool/terminal/issues)
3. Keep a changelog of features

# 🔑 Access
> I am currently in the process of becoming a Patreon creator with Foundry. Until that happens the module will not be available for download.

Until then you can follow me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/CodaBool) for updates.
